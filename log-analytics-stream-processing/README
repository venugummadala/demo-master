This is an analytics program which filters application request log extracts by a number of different properties.

Sample log files exist in 'resources' folder. A log extract file contains a header row, followed by zero or more data rows,
in comma-separated value format.
The first column is the Unix timestamp (in seconds) of the time the request was made, the second column is the country
from which the request originated, and the third column is the time in milliseconds which the request took to complete.
The data rows are not sorted, grouped, or ordered.

An example file is:

    REQUEST_TIMESTAMP,COUNTRY_CODE,RESPONSE_TIME
    1433190845,US,539
    1432917066,GB,37

Also refer to the test resources & unit tests for more examples.
